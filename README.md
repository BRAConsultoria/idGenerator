# idGenerator

A class written to generate unique id's fast. It's based on  [Twiter's snowflake](https://github.com/twitter/snowflake/tree/snowflake-2010)
With a more straight forward approach, and probably is a little bit less efficient.

# Install

You can install it by only downloading the class file on the src folder, or you can install it with composer.
Composer package name: webingpro/id-generator

# Usage
It's a one liner, so it's just:
$id = IdGenerator\IdGenerator::getId();
